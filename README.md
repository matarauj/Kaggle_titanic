# Kaggle_titanic
The purpose of this repo is to show a simple yet complete end-to-end Machine Learning project. It solves a classification problem by determining whether someone from the Titanic survived or not.
It was developed using JupyterLab, Visual Studio Code, Anaconda, and Streamlit Community Cloud (Streamlit Share).
